Certainly, the advice given by the royal advisor could be centered around a decision that, initially, seemed advantageous but later led to significant misfortune. Here's an idea for the advice:

**Advice Given:**
The royal advisor suggests a strategic military alliance with a neighboring kingdom to strengthen the queen's rule and ensure stability. This alliance involves marrying off a prince or princess to a member of the neighboring royal family, sealing the pact.

**Unforeseen Consequences:**
1. **Betrayal and Political Intrigue:**
   - The neighboring kingdom, feigning goodwill, uses the alliance to gain access to critical information about the queen's kingdom. Unbeknownst to the advisor, they have their own agenda and plan to exploit the alliance for their benefit.

2. **Economic Fallout:**
   - The terms of the alliance heavily favor the neighboring kingdom economically. Trade agreements become one-sided, draining the resources of the queen's kingdom and causing economic hardships for its people.

3. **Rebellion and Unrest:**
   - The unequal alliance sparks resentment among the queen's subjects, leading to widespread protests and rebellions. The people blame the royal advisor for the hardships they face as a result of the alliance.

4. **Loss of Lives in War:**
   - The alliance eventually leads to a conflict, as the neighboring kingdom exploits the situation to advance its territorial interests. The queen's kingdom suffers heavy casualties in the war, causing immense grief and loss.

**Haunting Regret:**
As the consequences unfold, the royal advisor witnesses the devastating impact of their advice on the kingdom and its people. The advisor becomes haunted by guilt, regretting the decisions that led to the suffering of many. The misfortune caused by their counsel becomes a central theme in the narrative, driving the advisor's internal struggle and quest for redemption.

The game could explore the advisor's efforts to undo the damage, confront the consequences of their actions, and seek a path to redemption. The haunting regret serves as a powerful emotional anchor for both the character and the player, creating a compelling story of responsibility and the consequences of seemingly well-intentioned decisions.
